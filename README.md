# Quicksort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) version of quicksort. Use the
template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some
basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

Hint: To make qicksort iterative, think about the part of the array each
recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

The $\Theta$ bound worst case for my implementation is $\Theta(n^2)$ This occurs when the pivot leads to unbalanced partitions. I choose the first element as the pivot so, for example, in an already sorted array, the partitioning and comparison will still occur for every element in the two while loops that move the elements to the left and right, resulting in $\Theta(n^2)$
